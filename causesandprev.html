    Though melanoma is the least common type of skin cancer, it is the most deadly. The longer melanoma is allowed to grow, the lower the survival rate gets with a five-year survival rate as low as 35% once it has developed into distant melanoma. Because melanoma is so deadly, it is crucial to know if you are at higher risk for melanoma and habits you can change to reduce that risk. </p>
    <p>

    The most common cause of melanoma is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. When melanocytes, skin cells that produce melanin, are exposed to UV rays, they can turn into cancerous cells. Cancerous cells are when the DNA of a cell instructs the cell to rapidly reproduce and continue living when they should die. UV light exposure is not the only cause of melanoma; other factors can change the DNA of cells, but is currently the leading cause of melanoma.</p>
    <p>

    Two ways that people’s skin can be exposed to UV light are: naturally from sunlight, or through UV light-producing products, such as tanning beds and nail polish curing lamps. To prevent exposure to UV light do not use tanning beds, as they can produce Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA rays) with energy up to 15 times more than from the UVA rays produced by the sun. To prevent UV exposure from the sun, reduce the amount of skin exposed to sunlight by wearing clothes that cover your skin and apply sunscreen to the areas that are exposed to the sun. The Melanoma Research alliance suggests using a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF level of at least 30. This will protect against 97% of UVB rays (another type of UV ray). The higher the SPF level, the more the sunscreen will protect skin from UVB rays.</p>

    Some people are more at risk for melanoma than others. People with lighter skin and lighter eyes are much more likely to develop melanoma. Certain genetic mutations are linked to melanoma, meaning that if one of your family members has a history of melanoma then you are more at risk. Additionally, personal history also plays a role in increased melanoma risk. People who have previously had melanoma or other skin cancers before are also at a higher risk of developing melanoma. Weakened immune system is another risk factor, people who have viruses that weaken the immune system, such as AIDs are more likely to have melanoma as well.</p>

    <p>
    Some cases of melanoma begin in moles. Moles are non-cancerous tumors but they can become cancerous. The American Cancer Society suggests that people with moles, check them monthly for abnormalities so that they can catch melanoma early on. While in most cases melanoma develops in normal skin, a high percentage from 20-30% also develops from existing moles. Atypical moles which are irregular in shape, size or color have more risk in becoming cancerous and develop melanocyte risks. </p>

                In recent years, melanoma has become increasingly prevalent. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, the age-adjusted rates for new melanoma cases have increased by approximately 1.1% annually from 2012 to 2021. This increase is attributed to factors like increased UV exposure from sunlight and artificial sources like tanning beds, but also stemming from environmental changes that elevate UV levels like the hole in the ozone layer. Melanoma is a serious but often preventable disease. By being mindful of your risk factors, you can take steps to protect yourself. Prevention and early detection saves lives. </p>
